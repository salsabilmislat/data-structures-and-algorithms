# Singly Linked List
**A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.**

## Challenge

**Build a linked list and Add to it nodes also check if values are inside the linked list or not**

## Approach & Efficiency

The Efficiency of the Big O time is O(n)

## API

### insert function

**Add to the linked list values**

### includes

**check if some items is in the linked list or not**

### to string (\__str__\)

**A string representing all the values in the Linked List**
