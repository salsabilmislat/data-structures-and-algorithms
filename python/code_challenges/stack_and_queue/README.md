# Stacks and Queues

**Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.A data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.**

## Challenge

**Build a Node class , Stack class , Queue Class with their method to add and remove also to check if it is empty**


## Approach & Efficiency

The Efficiency of the Big O time is O(1)


## API

### Stack methods

#### push

**put nodes in the stack**

#### pop

**delete or removed Nodes or items from the stack are popped**

#### peek

**view the value of the top Node in the stack**

#### isEmpty

**returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false**

### Queue methods

#### enqueue

**put or add nodes in the queue**

#### dequeue

**delete or removed Nodes or items from the queue**

#### peek

**view the value of the Front Node in the queue**

#### isEmpty

**returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.**
